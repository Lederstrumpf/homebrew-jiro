# homebrew-jiro
This repository contains homebrew formulae authored by me. To add this tap to your brew installation:

    brew tap Git-Jiro/jiro

If you have **not installed XCode** during installation of Homebrew, please **do so now!** [This page will explain **how to install a compiler for Homebrew**](http://docs.brew.sh/Installation.html).
Otherwise you will not be able to use any of these formulae.

Have fun!
